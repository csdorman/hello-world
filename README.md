# hello-world
Starting out with GitHub!

After reading a great article on learning to code front-end development in 10 months, I'm inspired!
I'm going to try to do a little bit of focused learning on improving my existing HTML/CSS knowledge.
I'm also going to try and start learning other languages, javascript, PHP, etc.
